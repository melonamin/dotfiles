// OpenCode lifecycle plugin installed by agterm's Help ▸ Install Agent Status Hooks… command.

//
// IMPORTANT: this module must export ONLY plugin function(s). OpenCode's legacy loader treats
// every export as a plugin and throws "Plugin export is not a function" on non-functions.

/**
 * OpenCode plugin entry. Named export — OpenCode loads plugins from ~/.config/opencode/plugins/.
 * This must remain the only export from this file.
 *
 * Every session of one OpenCode instance reports into the SAME agterm pane, so the three Sets below
 * track them together rather than per-session:
 * - `active`: sessionIDs that have seen busy/retry. Idle for one id is ignored until that id was
 *   busy; COMPLETED fires only when the set is empty after removing the id, so a task subagent's
 *   busy/idle pair cannot paint completed onto a still-busy parent (or another top-level session).
 * - `errored`: sessionIDs that hit a turn-ending session.error. Their own following idle (the one
 *   SessionProcessor.halt publishes right after) is swallowed and the id stays latched, so a SIBLING
 *   idling later cannot report completed over the blocked either. Cleared on the next busy/retry, or
 *   set-wide once everything is idle.
 * - `overflow`: sessionIDs that hit ContextOverflowError, whose meaning is only known from the next
 *   event — busy means auto-compaction resumed (no blocked), idle means the turn ended (blocked).
 * Abort/interrupt is never latched, so Esc ends on completed --auto-reset, which self-clears.
