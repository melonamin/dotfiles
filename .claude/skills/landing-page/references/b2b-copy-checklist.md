# B2B Copy Checklist

Review landing page copy against these guidelines before shipping. Each section addresses a common B2B messaging pitfall observed in real landing page builds.

## Partnership Sensitivity

When the product integrates with or extends another platform:

- Use "works with [Platform]" or "built for [Platform]" — not "replaces" or "better than"
- If you are a platform partner, state it: "Official [Platform] partner" or "[Platform] technology partner"
- Reference the platform respectfully — their users are your potential users
- Avoid positioning against the platform you depend on

## Currency and Locale Neutrality

- Do not hardcode currency symbols unless the product is region-specific
- Use "starting at" or "from" pricing language that works across locales
- If showing prices, support the user's locale or default to USD with a note
- Avoid date formats that are ambiguous across regions (use "19 February 2026" not "02/19/26")

## Free Tier Messaging

For B2B products, "free" carries different connotations than in B2C:

- Enterprise buyers are skeptical of free — "nothing good is free" is the default assumption
- Position free tiers as "Developer" or "Starter" plans, not "Free"
- Emphasize what the free tier enables (e.g., "Get started with up to 10K events/month") rather than the price
- Always show an upgrade path — free tiers without visible paid options signal an unserious product
- If open source, lead with "open source" not "free" — open source has credibility in B2B

## Social Proof

### Early-Stage (No Customers Yet)

When the product has no customer logos or testimonials:

- **Team credentials** — "Built by engineers from [respected companies]" or "Team with [X years] of experience in [domain]"
- **Technical expertise** — "Contributors to [open source project]" or "Based on [published research/methodology]"
- **Community signals** — GitHub stars, Discord members, newsletter subscribers
- **Backed by** — Investor logos if from recognized firms
- Do NOT fabricate testimonials or use stock photos as fake customers

### Growth-Stage (Some Customers)

- Lead with the strongest logos you have permission to use
- Quantify results: "Reduced query time by 10x" beats "Great product"
- Use specific titles: "Sarah Chen, VP Engineering at Acme" not "Happy Customer"
- 3-5 strong testimonials beats 20 generic ones

## CTA Strategy

### Primary CTA

- One primary CTA per viewport — do not compete with yourself
- Use action verbs: "Start building", "Deploy now", "Get started" — not "Learn more" or "Submit"
- Match the CTA to the user's stage: top-of-page CTAs should be low-commitment ("Try free", "See demo"), bottom-of-page CTAs can be higher-commitment ("Start your project", "Talk to sales")

### Secondary CTA

- Provide a secondary option for users not ready for the primary: "Read the docs", "View pricing", "Watch demo"
- Style secondary CTAs as text links or ghost buttons — visually subordinate to primary

### Sign-In for Existing Users

- Always include a subtle "Sign in" link in the header for returning users
- Do not make sign-in compete visually with the primary CTA
- Position: top-right header, text link or ghost button

## Tone Guidelines

### B2B Professional Tone

- **Confident, not hyperbolic** — "Handles millions of events per second" beats "Revolutionary game-changing platform"
- **Specific, not vague** — Quantify claims. "99.99% uptime SLA" beats "Highly reliable"
- **Technical credibility** — Use domain-specific terms your audience knows. Do not dumb down for a technical audience
- **Respect the reader's time** — Every sentence should earn its place. Cut marketing fluff ruthlessly

### Words to Avoid

- "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "disruptive", "cutting-edge" — overused and meaningless
- "Leverage", "synergy", "paradigm" — corporate jargon that signals nothing
- "Simple" or "easy" without evidence — show simplicity through UI screenshots or code samples
- "AI-powered" as the primary value prop — say what the AI does, not that it exists

### Words That Work

- "Built for [specific audience]" — signals intentional design
- "Handles [specific scale]" — quantifies capability
- "Ships with [specific feature]" — concrete deliverable
- "Used by [specific team type]" — social proof through audience identification
